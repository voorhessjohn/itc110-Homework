**Chapter 3, Questions 1- 14**
--------------------------

**1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?**
Functions serve to help avoid repeating code.

**2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?**
The code in a function executes when the function is called, after it is defined.

**3. What statement creates a function?**
`def` creates a function.

**4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?**
A function is the `def` statement that defines it and all of the code therein. A function call moves the program to the block of code that defines the function and executes it.

**5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?**
There is one global scope in a Python program and an unlimited number of local scopes.

**6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?**
The variables are not saved and they are destroyed when the function call returns.

**7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?**
A return value is the result of the evaluation of a function.  Yes.

**8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?**
The return value of a call to a function without a return statement is None.

**9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?**
You can define the global variable in the function with a`global` statement.

**10. What is the data type of None?**
NoneType

**11. What does the `import areallyourpetsnamederic` statement do?**
It imports a module called `areallyourpetsnamederic`.

**12. If you had a function named `bacon()` in a module named `spam,` how would you call it after importing spam?**

    spam.bacon()

**13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?**
You can use a `try / except` clause for problematic code.

**14. What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?**
Code that may cause an error goes in the `try` clause.  Code that executes when an error happens goes in the `except` clause.
