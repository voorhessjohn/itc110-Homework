Homework 2 - p.60 all questions


1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them? 

The Two values of the boolean data type are True and False.  They are always written with a capital T and a capital F. 
2.What are the three Boolean operators? 

and
or
not 
3.Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to). 

True and True is True
True and False is False
False and True is False
False and False is True
True or True is True
True or False is True
False or True is True
False or False is False
not True is False
not False is True 
4.What do the following expressions evaluate to? 
 (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) is False
not (5 > 4) is False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) is True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) is False
(True and True) and (True == False) is False
(not False) or (not True) is True
	
5.What are the six comparison operators? 

==
<
>
!=
<=
>= 
6.What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator? 

Assignment operator, “=”, assigns a value to a variable.  Equal to operator, “==”, compares two values. 
7.Explain what a condition is and where you would use one. 

A condition evaluates to True or False and is used in flow control. 
8.Identify the three blocks in this code:  
spam = 0 BLOCK 1
if spam == 10: BLOCK 2
	print('eggs')
	if spam > 5:
		print('bacon')
	else:
		print('ham')
	print('spam')
print('spam') BLOCK 3 
		 
9.Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam. 


if spam == 1:
	print(‘Hello’)
elif spam == 2:
	print(‘Howdy’)
else:
	print(‘Greetings!’) 
10.What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop? 

CTRL + C 
11.What is the difference between break and continue? 

If an execution reaches a break statement, it will immediately exit a while loop’s clause. When it reaches a continue statement, it will immediately jump back to the start of the loop and reevaluate. 
12.What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and 

range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop? 
range(10) is for 0 to 9
range(0, 10) tells the loop to start at 10
range(0, 10, 1) does the same as the previous but tells it to increment by one. 
13.Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop. 

for i in range(1, 11):
	print(i)

i = 1
while i <= 10:
	print(i)
	i = i + 1 
14.If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam? 

spam.bacon()
 Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
